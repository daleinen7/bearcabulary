## Intro

Bearcabulary is a word game built in Gatsby targeted at K-3rd Grade students. The player must choose from jumbled words to complete the missing word in a sentence. The user sees the word flash quickily at the start of each screen.

Once the screen disappears they can press play on an audio recording to hear the word they are trying to spell. They can also see the definition of it for context clues.

## Run Bearcabulary Locally or Host it Yourself

Bearcabulary is meant to be hosted and edited for your educational needs. Clone or fork the repo to your local machine or your github account. Run it on your local machine by running `gatsby develop` or `npm start` from the root directory. Or host it for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Once you've forked/cloned it and signed up for a free Netlify account, click the big green "New Site From Git" button.

Once you find it, select it and you'll finally be ready to deploy your new site.

Now you have your own version of Bearcabulary!

## Netlify CMS

We made Bearcabulary easy to add stories and puzzles to by utilizing NetlifyCMS. Once your site is deployed if you go to the url and add `/admin` and you'll be taken to your very own admin section.

From here you can add a new story (or series of puzzle screens).

Each section added will be a new puzzle for the student to figure out. If you only want a story and not a puzzle, simply don't fill out the "word" input and the image will be full size!

Once you publish your changes, Netlify will automatically re-build your site, and the content you created will be saved on your github account. This allows you to easily keep track of where your art and stories are kept.

## History

Bearcabulary was organically built with a team of 9 in a 3 day Hackathon. The team received 1st place in the competition presented to a panel of judges as well as the People's Choice Award.

Afterwards, two of the members decided to build it from the ideas started at the Hackathon.
